# npm resolution error report

While resolving: puabo-os-mobile@0.1.0
Found: react@18.2.0
node_modules/react
  react@"18.2.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^19.0.0" from react-dom@19.0.0
node_modules/react-dom
  react-dom@"19.0.0" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
